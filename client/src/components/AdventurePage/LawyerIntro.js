        It was the week after the biggest case of your career. Your partner and
        best friend at the firm, Jim Jimmison, was throwing you a celebration
        party. Drinks, drugs, and women were abundantly available. A wealthy
        widow settled on a case she didn't have the energy or time to focus on.
        Jim and you have made most of your money on preying on poor individuals
        who you assume will settle. You hired a programmer to auto submit cases
        with a high settlement likelihood. You don't how it works, but it works.
        He went by the name, Hindsight. All these tech weirdos have strange
        aliases, you didn't care, you saw the potential in what he offered. It
        was a few months back and you were hanging out at your local watering
        hole. Down on your luck and a string of lost cases, you were desperate
        for a win. This was the night he approached you. "Hello,{" "}
        {char.character_name}, you seem down on your luck", he said. A few
        drinks in, you stammer back, "yeah, what's it to ya, you punk!". He
        smiles and asks, "What if I could help you change your luck?". "HAH, if
        you could change MY luck I'd make you a rich man", you say. "Looks like
        I'll be a rich man", he chuckles. He sits down at the bar next to you
        and pulls a laptop from his backpack. He starts showing you all sorts of
        graphs and data. "Get to the point, I don't know what any of this nerd
        shit is. I'm a lawyer, not a data scientist!", you yell. Still smiling
        he pulls up something you recognize, an excel sheet. It was what was on
        this sheet that astounded you though. A list of names, phone numbers,
        addresses, and dates. These dates you instantly recognized. "Those are
        pending statute of limitations!", you drunkenly shout. "Shhhh, yes I
        know, are you interested?" asks Hindsight. After that night everything
        changed. You starting winning case after case. It wasn't a matter of
        your skill as a lawyer. It was just a numbers game. With more money in
        your pocket than ever before, you and Jim started partying more and
        more. So it was late into the night and the party was dying down. "Jim,
        we'll never worry again!" you say. "Damn right {char.character_name}! I
        don't know how you do it, it's like God himself blessed you with the
        luck of a King! says Jim. "Maybe it is the luck of God, maybe I just
        have good hindsight", you belch back. "One last round!", Jim says to the
        bartender.You two down your last shot and head out to the streets.
        Stumbling your way back to your hotel a few blocks away, the night was
        quiet. It was Jim to notice him first. A lone figure standing on the
        other side of the street, staring at the two of you. "Hey fuck off you
        twat!", screams Jim. "Yeah eat a dick", you yell. "That's not very
        nice", the stranger says back as he starts crossing the street towards
        the two of you. Drunkenly putting his dukes up, Jim is ready to fight.
        "You want some! Huh, I'll kick your ass", yells Jim. It was at this
        moment everything starts spinning and going black. BANG. A shot went
        off. Jim was dead, a hole clean through his head. You start passing out
        and as you fall over, the last thing you see was his face. Chuckling the
        same as when you first met him. "Time to pay up", says Hindsight.
